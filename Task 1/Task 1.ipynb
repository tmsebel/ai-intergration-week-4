    "## Efficiency Analysis\n",
    "The manual implementation uses Python’s `sorted()` function with a `lambda` to sort a list of dictionaries by a specified key. It leverages Timsort, Python’s optimized sorting algorithm, with a time complexity of O(n log n). It includes error handling for missing keys and supports ascending/descending order via the `reverse` parameter, making it robust and concise.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hypothetical AI-suggested version uses bubble sort, which has a time complexity of O(n²) due to nested loops comparing and swapping elements. It lacks error handling for missing keys and doesn’t support reverse sorting, reducing its flexibility. Additionally, it makes a copy of the input list, which is unnecessary for sorting in most cases, adding slight memory overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "The manual implementation is more efficient for large datasets because Timsort is significantly faster than bubble sort, especially for partially sorted data. Timsort’s adaptive nature optimizes real-world use cases, while bubble sort performs poorly as list size grows. The manual version’s error handling and flexibility further enhance its practicality. For general-purpose sorting, the manual implementation is superior due to its performance, robustness, and simplicity.\n",

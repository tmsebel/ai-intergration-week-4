# Test Summary: AI-Enhanced Test Coverage

AI significantly improves test coverage compared to manual testing by enabling rapid, scalable, and precise automation. The Selenium script provided automates login testing for valid and invalid credentials, ensuring consistent execution and accurate result tracking (e.g., 100% success rate in simulated results). AI-driven tools generate diverse test cases, including edge cases, by analyzing application behavior and user patterns, identifying issues manual testers might miss. Unlike manual testing, which is constrained by human resources and time, AI dynamically adapts to code changes or user data, creating new test scenarios. It minimizes human error, supports continuous testing, and integrates with CI/CD pipelines for real-time feedback. Manual testing struggles with repetitive tasks and complex systems, while AI prioritizes high-risk areas and simulates real-world conditions, ensuring robust validation of login functionality and enhancing overall software quality.
